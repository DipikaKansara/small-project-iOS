## About this repository
This repository contains an empty swift storyboard xcode project with CocoaPods initialised.

## Your Tasks
Task 1. The first view controller should have a single text input where you can write a YouTube Video ID. Once the user clicks a "Watch" button, the Video ID is checked to be valid. If valid, a YouTube video player opens with the entered Video ID in a new View Controller.
Task 2. In the Video Player View Controller, include a share button which will share the video URL to other apps. 

You have complete creative freedom over the appearance of the app. Tests are not required.
